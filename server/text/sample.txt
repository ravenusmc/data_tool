Swimsuit shopping, much like shopping for bras, always gets a little difficult for me. I'm a 32DD, and for some reason, it seems like the swimsuit industry is usually geared toward smaller sizes. But unlike my hatred for bra-shopping (why must I put so much effort into something that never sees the light of day?), I do actually love shopping for bikinis.

Over the years, I've become an expert on deciphering what's going to look good on me versus what my chest will immediately spill out of just by looking at a product image online. After much trial and error, the winning styles are, in no particular order, as follows: underwire, sporty, bandeau, and triangle. And within all those styles, I'm pretty specific on how I decide whether they'll be added to my cart. (Extra fabric plus a tie in the back is a winning combo in my books.)

Even though it's prime L.A. beach season, I'm also shopping for things to wear when I sunbathe on my balcony. Have a similar cup size as me or just looking for some really cute bathing suits to add to your swim drawer? Keep scrolling for 25 cute, DD-approved pieces.
