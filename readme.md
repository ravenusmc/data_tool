# Data_Tool
## Intro

This is a project that I've thought about for quite sometime now. In sometime, I mean years! Basically, I want to create a simple tool like Tableau or DOMO that will allow me to analyze 
simple CSV files. The basic functionality would be that you load a csv file and then can 
look the data through some basic data visualizations.

Part of this project has been built out and appears to work. You can upload any text document 
to it and it will tell you the sentiment analysis of that sentence. It also breaks the text 
document down and tells you other things like common word count, sentiment by sentence and 
graphs this for you. 

I will say that I'm not sure if I'll ever finish this project. There may be parts that I can't 
figure out how to build. I may also continually be adding more and more parts to it as to 
build a fairly robust data tool. We'll see where this goes. For now it's time to start the adventure...
